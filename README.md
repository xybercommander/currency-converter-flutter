I got the inspiration of this app's UI design from this beautiful interface by <a href="https://dribbble.com/Volorf" target="_blank">Oleg Frolov</a></br>

## The Api Used
The API which I used in this project is : https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=THEBASECURRENCY<br>
This API calls back Currency Convertion Factors for 32 other Currencies for the base currency.
<strong>Therefore I made a Map of 33*33 elements which can be found in the file currencyAPI.dart : <br>
